**Joined Node** is a simple, lightweight, and secure way of running isolated backend code that removed or reduces the need for a backend.

It is a secure and cost efficient solution to the challange of supporting **extensibility through custom code in multi-tenant systems**.

It is an ideal companion for **mobile or single page applications that need just a little bit of a backend**.

Finally, Joined Node tasks are a flexible and lightweight mechanism that supports a variety of **integration scenarios**.

The Joined Node service was created and is supported by [Flybase](http://flybase.io). In fact, we are using Joined Node internally as a key element of our real-time app backend platform.
