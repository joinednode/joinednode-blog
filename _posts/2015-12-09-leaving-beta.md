We're excitedly preparing to leave beta and go into public launch, and it's a time we couldn't be happier about.

Joined Node brings an entirely new approach to building backend apps, letting developers focus on their code and not worry about servers.

The days of monolithic services are gone, now we focus on microservices. Building one recipe that does one job and does it very very well.

Some features are still in testing, we have our CLI tool coming out shortly as well as scheduled recipes which are recipes that can be set to run hourly, once a day, once a week, etc.
